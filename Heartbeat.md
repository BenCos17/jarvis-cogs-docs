# Heartbeat Help

Monitor the uptime of your bot.<br/><br/>The bot owner can specify a URL that the bot will ping (send a GET request)<br/>at a configurable frequency. Using this with an uptime tracking service can<br/>warn you when your bot isn't connected to the internet (and thus usually<br/>not connected to Discord).

# MadTranslate Help

Translate things into lots of languages then back to English!<br/><br/>This will defiantly have some funny moments... Take everything with a pinch of salt!

# madtranslate
 - Usage: `[p]madtranslate [count=15] <text_to_translate> `
 - Aliases: `mtranslate and mtrans`

Translate something into lots of languages, then back to English!<br/><br/>**Examples:**<br/>- `[p]mtrans This is a sentence.`<br/>- `[p]mtrans 25 Here's another one.`<br/><br/>At the bottom of the output embed is a count-seed pair. You can use this with<br/>the `mtransseed` command to use the same language set.

# mtransseed
 - Usage: `[p]mtransseed <count_seed> <text_to_translate> `

Use a count-seed pair to (hopefully) get reproducible results.<br/><br/>They may be unreproducible if Google Translate changes its translations.<br/><br/>The count-seed pair is obtained from the main command, `mtrans`, in the embed footer.<br/><br/>**Examples:**<br/>- `[p]mtrans 15-111111 This is a sentence.`<br/>- `[p]mtrans 25-000000 Here's another one.`
